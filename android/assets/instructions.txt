How To Play Cirsect
Cirsect is a calming, meditative game with very simple rules.  You have to pop floating dots on the screen.  You do this by placing a single explosion on the screen.  If a dot collides with it, it will explode.  Only by chaining explosions together can you win!


You get one move per level
You can place one, and only one, explosion on each level. When all the explosions are over, if you have popped enough dots, you will advance to the next level.


No ads, no in-game purchases
This is a side project for me and I'm not looking to make any money off it.
